about = Humanitarian aid center «Volonter-68» started working in Kharkiv since full scale invasion began. Every single day within this horrific year we help those who need it, we help people who have hard times. And we are not going to stop helping! This is why we really need your help.
    Our care receivers are elderly people, people with disabilities, large families, bedridden patients, lonely old men and women and other people who need urgent evacuation out of shelling.

    We help these people with:

    Evacuation. Over 1000 people including limited mobility and bedridden people have already been evacuated to safe places. We have two special purpose vehicles for transportation and a great and caring team.
    Targeted social aid. Food sets, diapers, medicine, pet food - we provided over 80 thousands of food sets and aid kits. We also provide health care workers who can cope with different tasks from bandaging to assistance with payment processing.
    We cooperate with volunteers initiative groups and charity funds from Ukraine and worldwide. Everyone in Ukraine has to know that none is abandoned. We are here to help you.
